## OVERVIEW
The objective of this project is to analyze CO₂ emissions generated by the agricultural sector, understand the sources contributing to these emissions, and examine the trends over recent years. Using datasets from the FAO, IPCC, and other reputable climate data sources, the project aims to quantify agricultural emissions, assess their impact on climate change, and suggest actionable strategies to reduce emissions. The focus will be on understanding the role of different agricultural practices, land-use changes, and livestock management in CO₂ production and finding ways to mitigate these impacts.
## PURPOSE 
The purpose of this project is to address the significant impact of agricultural practices on climate change by analyzing CO₂ emissions within the agricultural sector. It aims to:

Quantify Agricultural Emissions: Measure and understand the sources and volume of CO₂ emissions from agriculture, identifying specific contributors like land use, livestock, and crop production.

Evaluate Climate Impact: Assess how agricultural emissions contribute to climate change, particularly in terms of soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and impacts on water and air quality. This includes understanding the potential threats to food security and agricultural productivity.

Predict Future Trends: Use historical data and predictive modeling to project future emissions under different agricultural practices and policy scenarios. This will help stakeholders anticipate the long-term environmental and economic implications of current practices.

Develop Mitigation Strategies: Identify and propose sustainable practices that can reduce CO₂ emissions, such as regenerative farming, carbon sequestration, and improved land management. The project seeks to provide concrete strategies that farmers, businesses, and policymakers can adopt to minimize agricultural emissions.

Support Policy and Stakeholder Decision-Making: Equip policymakers, agricultural businesses, and researchers with actionable data and insights. This supports informed decision-making that promotes sustainable agricultural practices, aligns with global climate goals, and ensures the long-term viability of food systems.
